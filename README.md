#  Midia


![Swift Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/swift-4.2-orange.svg)

### Midia is an App that allows you to register your favorites books and movies from Google Books and iTunes APIs. Soon you'll be able to also search for Games.

## REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES
Searchs through Google Books API requires a **valid Key**.
The app won't search for books if you don't add one. Fill the field Google_API_Key from the file **Info.plist** with a valid key and everything will be ready.

## VERSIONS AND WARNIGS
This is an exercice for the 8th Mobile Development Bootcamp from KeepCoding.
The Extra part has been developed trying to mix the fundametals with the advanced iOS modules. 
**I'm aware that needs major refactors and that the solutions are quite far from ellegance.**
*A better solution for StorageManager would make a much cleaner code*
